# Meetup Boulder Data Science 2016

Scikit-learn provides a consistent framework that makes applying many of the standard machine learning algorithms fairly straightforward. It is certainly one of the reasons that data analysis is becoming so popular in Python.  This tutorial will give an overview of of the types of problems that can be addressed with Scikit-Learn. We will use several code examples to explain some of the basic concepts of machine learning, including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
